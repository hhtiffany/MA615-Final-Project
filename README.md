* ui.R, server.R & www - for shiny app
* Data - for both shiny app and R Rmd
* html and pdf documents
* The original shiny I created work well on my computer but when I upload to shinyapps.io, quick Disconnected from the server. This may due to the gid dataset. Thus I created a shiny only contains the map.
